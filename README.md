Interactive Development Assignment 1

◍◍◍Personal Portfolio Site◍◍◍
In this portfolio, I have used my knowledge in html, css, javascript to create a portfolio that will showcase more about me, my personal and school programming projects, work experiences and various way you can contact me.

◍◍◍Design Process◍◍◍
This site is to mainly showcase the projects I have did so far as a Year1 Student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic to showcase it to recruiters or universities to hire/enroll me. As a recruiter/university, I would like to see what are the things that the student has did so far. This project not only showcase to them my html, css, javascript skills, I could also showcase them the past projects I have did in a more attractive manner.

I have created 2 wireframes before starting on this project and settled on the 2nd one. You can take a look at the wireframe in the "Wireframe" folder.

◍◍◍Features◍◍◍
Existing Features:
I have created 4 seperate features

Home - where viewers are welcomed to the portfolio website and there will be a button in the button named "More about me" for users to click and view more about me

About - This is where viewers can learn a bit more about me as a person

Portfolio - This is the part where viewers can see my various projects that I have did ever since when I was Secondary 3.

Contact - This is where viewers can contact me if they wish to ask any questions.

Features Left to Implement:
As I would to study to study more about ICT in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I would have completed more projects hence I would like to include perhaps a list (e.g. Discord Bot, App Icon Design, Sim City Game), they would be able to just select a few to view.

Technologies Used:
As this is a individual project and I had to start from scratch, I couldn't use bootstrap or J Query. However I went through multiple tutorials online such as W3Schools, Linkedin Learning to learn more about html and css.
